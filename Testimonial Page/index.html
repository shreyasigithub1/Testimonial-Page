            <h3>Verified Graduate</h3>
             <p> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were 
             current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth!!<br/><br/>
             "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a 
             transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the 
             free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was 
             the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched 
             careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

             <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!!<br/><br/>
                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who 
                can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only 
                say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on 
                and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my 
                learning to the next level in"</p>
